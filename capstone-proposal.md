 ## Project Proposal

 Step Two is all about fleshing out your project idea. For this step, please write a proposal based on the project idea you agreed on with your mentor. This proposal should be a 1-2 page document that answers the following questions:

 1. What tech stack will you use for your final project? 
 React and Node

 2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?
 The front-end UI will be the primary focus.

 3. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
 This will be a responsive web application.

 4. What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
 Allow users to have a text-based conversation with an AI Chatbot in real-time.

 5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?
 Adults of all ages and genders. 

 6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
 AI-generated responses to user questions. Data will be collected to an API.

 7. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project:

 * a. What does your database schema look like?
 No database is needed.

 * b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? 
 There may be connection issues and/or issues awaiting API data.

 * c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
 No.

 * d. What functionality will your app include?
 The app will include a form that allows the user to input a question. Answers from an AI Chatbot will display as responses in the form.

 * e. What will the user flow look like?
 The user will interact with the AI Chatbot in real-time via the form. 

 * f. What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your stretch goals?
 I will train the AI Chatbot to answer questions in a specialized way. My stretch goal is to build in audio features.
